  <h2>Why I Chose the Rivian R1S (Gen 2)</h2>
  <p>
    As a former Tesla Model X owner, I knew I wanted to stay electric‚Äîbut I no longer felt comfortable supporting a brand led by someone whose values I don‚Äôt align with. I had the means to switch, and Rivian was the clear choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    The R1S Gen 2 fits my family perfectly. It offers more space, and with the Max Battery Pack, it even beats the Model X in range. The quality? Easily on par with Tesla‚Äîif not better. From the design to the driving experience, the R1S feels like the luxury SUV I was looking for. And I love that Rivian is committed to building an electric vehicle that's truly made for all terrain adventures.
